In this tutorial, we will discover, step by step, the :mod:`polyadicqml` package.

At first, we learn how to define a **parametric quantum circuit**.
Then, we understand how to train and test a **Quantum Classifier**.
Finally, we see the different backends supported by this package.

At the end of the tutorial, you should be able to use a Quantum Classifier for any problem, provided you have enough computing power.
